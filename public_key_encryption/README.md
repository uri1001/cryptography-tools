<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Once the code is hosted locally, it is highly recommended to have it all under a separate directory

There is no need to create any extra directories, the program itself will do so

### Permissions

Execution permission is required as follows (command execution must be in the directory where merkle_tree.sh is located)

1. Give execution permission
   ```sh
   sudo chmod 700 ./main.sh
   ```
2. Execute
   ```sh
   ./main.sh
   ```
