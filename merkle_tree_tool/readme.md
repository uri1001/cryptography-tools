</div>

<!-- FUNCTIONALITIES -->

## SHA Functions

The tool works with the following OpenSSL SHA Algorithms: sha1 / sha224 / sha256 / sha384 / sha512

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Once the code is hosted locally, it is highly recommended to have it all under a separate directory

There is no need to create any extra directories, the program itself will do so

### Permissions

Execution permission is required as follows (command execution must be in the directory where merkle_tree.sh is located)

1. Give execution permission
   ```sh
   sudo chmod 700 ./merkle_tree.sh
   ```
2. Execute
   ```sh
   ./merkle_tree.sh
   ```
